        If you go into a situation expecting to fail, there's a pretty good chance you're going to fail. If you think you're going to do a great job, you're far more likely to succeed at the task than if you are constantly second-guessing yourself. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So why are you second-guessing yourself in the first place? Is it because you're trying something again that you've already failed at? Is it because it's something new that you're unsure of? Did you just see somebody else fail and think, "Geez, that really does look hard! I wonder if I'll be able to do any better?"? That's human nature. Not everyone goes into every task expecting to kill it and be awesome at everything. In fact, failure is part of growth, and successes rarely come without some or many failures. 
      </p>

      <p>
        But now imagine if all this second-guessing yourself has nothing to do with the actual context of your life. It's not based on past experience, not based on knowledge of how difficult a task is, not based on seeing someone else try and fail and honestly wondering if you can do it. No, you're second guessing yourself and your abilities because you happen to belong to a group that others have prejudgments about, one that faces negative expectations before even walking into the room. If others expect you to fail without even knowing you, based on your sex, your skin color, your religion, or any other outward characteristic, they are stereotyping you and all your peers. And Stereotype Threat is when this poor expectation based on a negative stereotype of you becomes real; it's when you come to believe the ugliness. Stereotype Threat is the idea that, if others think you'll fail based on one or another characteristic, then you'll believe it too, and you'll fulfill the prophecy.

        As a white male in America, I am part of a group that suffers far less stereotype threat than many other groups. Sadly, white males tend to be the group doing much of the stereotyping. But I do remember being in graduate school for teaching, as the only male in a cohort of twelve other female students and three or four (depending on the day) female professors, and feeling like a real token minority for the first time. Why was I there? Why weren't there any other males? And why did everyone keep asking me for "the male perspective" - often about issues for which I hadn't yet formed a perspective at all - as if I represented the entire male race, while all of my cohort mates were able to form and have their own, very different, opinions? Did I, and had I ever, embodied "the male perspective"? I sure didn't feel like it. But there I was trying to play along.

        My example wasn't harmful to me, at least no more so than sending me running from the elementary teaching field. But it was amazing to feel what it was like to be the minority in a group, to be asked for a "group" opinion when I had absolutely no authority to give it. When asked to give the male opinion, I realized, the opinion I would give often wasn't my own. I stopped being me. It's easy to extend this feeling to the example in <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">Steele &amp; Aronson (1995)</a> of the black college students who, when told black students statistically performed worse than white students on certain standardized tests, did perform worse, but who, when race wasn't mentioned, did as well or better on the tests than the white students. These students became the group the stereotypers told them they were.

        When expected by others to fail, when told by others they would fail, they would in turn come to expect themselves to fail, and indeed end up failing. Stereotype Threat is when the unfounded opinions of others are allowed to shape your own opinions of yourself, to the point where your life is affected. Instead of being the individual you are, you become the face of a group. You become the group, ascribed dangerously false and unfounded assumptions. You disappear, and false and harmful stereotypes come true - others' expectations become real, no matter how far-fetched and harmful they may be.
