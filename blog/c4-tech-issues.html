        With the FCC's recent passage of new rules on net neutrality (the idea that everyone deserves the same access to the internet), the touchy subject has reentered the news sphere in a big way.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the one hand, these laws make lots of sense. With Internet access in America increasingly tied up in the offerings of very few, very large, providers, ISPs like Comcast have disproportionate power over the net. It makes sense to try to limit this since Comcast has felt like a monopoly to many for a very long time. The Internet really is a public utility, and the public is beholden to a few major companies for access. The Netflix example is a good one. Netflix favors net neutrality because it is a huge user of bandwidth, and if Comcast or other ISPs started charging Netflix based on their use, it would be a huge cost for them, that they would likely pass onto us, the consumers. Nobody wants their prices raised. 
      </p>

      <p>
        And why should Netflix have to pay for its own success? Would smaller upstart online content providers immediately have to start paying their Internet meter as well? This could prevent small new companies with limited funding from ever being able to get started, and in essence have the opposite of the intended effect by only allowing large corporations with deep pockets to foot the bill for the bandwidth required by their services. Would Facebook ever have come to be if they needed to pay for their bandwidth? Now Facebook is huge, but it wasn't commercial at all when it began in a dorm room. New companies with limited cash and an unknown customer base would struggle to pay large fees for data for an uncertain number of new customers. It would force monetization at an early stage when perhaps focus should be on development and setting and reaching product goals. It could become a "You have to have money to make money" situation.
      </p>

      <p>
         On the other hand, though, does the American public really want the United States Government monitoring this? Would the addition of a bureaucratic behemoth that makes decisions at glacial speeds really help to open up this market to the little guys? That seems hard to believe. The FCC is not generally known for open-mindedness and efficiency! 
      </p>

      <p>
        There isn't necessarily a right answer here. Americans in general have a pretty raw deal, paying 300% or 400% more for middling Internet service than many other countries' citizens pay for modern, super-fast connections. We are stuck paying out the nose for truly mediocre service and customer service from bloated corporations focused on their bottom lines and using as much old, existing infrastructure with minimal innovation as they can. They want to make the most money for the least amount of work, keeping up with the rest of the world be damned. On the other hand, is throwing the U.S. Government into the mix going to improve the situation? Is another bureaucratic layer what the doctor ordered? Yikes. I guess only time will tell.
