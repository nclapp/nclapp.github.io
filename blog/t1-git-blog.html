      I spent this first week of DevBootcamp learning about version control, Git, and GitHub, and how to use the command line to use these features. While any new skill is difficult at first, repetition really does help solidify an understanding of these ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is self explanatory in the sense that the name "version control" gives a good indication of what it is about. It is essentially a way to save versions of your work along the way, saving snapshots through time as you progress. Make a big, great, change that you love? Save a version so you can move forward with peace of mind. About to try something crazy and worried about damaging your previous work? Save a version! You're safe. Just make a mistake and break your entire project? Revert to a previously saved version! Some of our reading described version management loosely as a checkpoint in a video game - if you "die," never fear, you didn't lose all your work. You don't have to go back and start over. You've been using version control, so all is well!
    </p>
    <p>
      One version control management system, the one we use in DevBootcamp, is called "Git." Like, "Go on, git!" It's a funny name and because of this I remember hearing about it before getting started at DBC. But hearing about it is different than being able to define it! GitHub, also, rang a bell, but again, I had no idea what it was other than some website that a certain group of people LOVED and used regularly. I was not one of those people. I am now!
    </p>
    <p>
      One key facet to understanding Git and GitHub is getting that they are NOT THE SAME! This is important. The key difference is that Git is on your computer, while GitHub is online. Git itself is the version control system, and using Git, you save versions of your work as you progress. These versions are saved to your Git repository locally (on your computer). If working as part of a team, or if you simply want all your work to be available remotely so you can access it from different places, you'll want to keep this Git repository online, at a website like GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub basically provides a remote place online where your code or other work lives so it can be accessed by you and those to whom you give permission to view it, or change it as it may be. Another helpful, if oversimplified, analogy from the reading is to compare GitHub to a service like Dropbox. Before Dropbox, if you wanted to travel with some files, you'd have to take your whole laptop, or transfer some files to a flash drive. With Dropbox, like with GitHub, those files are now instantly available anywhere, any time, without having to plan ahead and travel with a little thumb drive or something. An added advantage is that others are able to access your work too, make changes if it's a shared project, and upload their changes to your main copy without endangering your work or making any big, permanent changes that may or may not be accepted. Because everyone is using version control, everyone can recommend their own changes, and then the group as a whole can decide what to keep.

      Woohoo!
