        I started this week very confident about my HTML skills and enjoyed the refresher, and ended the week with my tail between my legs lamenting CSS and its outrageous determination to completely elude me.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I understand the usefulness of CSS at its most simple level, i.e. to streamline stylizing websites by allowing you to put a lot of important style info in one place so changing it requires only one change instead of one change in every single element you wish to change, its ability to move, align, and position elements has filled me with frustration and self-doubt. Repeating "I am awesome!" does not work when things aren't working for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the problem for me was the interplay between ```display``` and ```position``` properties. For this blog post, I will try to describe the ```position``` property and its multiple behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normal flow is simply when each block-level element (like ```<h1>```, ```<p>```, etc.) sits atop the next, so the first one is on top, the second one below, the third one below that, etc. If you have two elements that are only half as wide as the page that could fit on the page side-by-side, they won't; they'll just stack on top of one another even though they could fit. This is normal flow: from top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relative flow is the closest cousin to normal flow, since you are basically adjusting an element's position relative to where it would appear in normal flow. Other surrounding elements are not affected. So if you have three paragraphs, you could move the middle one (for instance) down and to the right any number of pixels, percentage points, or em-spaces. Assign relative flow to an element by inserting the CSS code ```position: relative``` in its stylesheet. Then tell it where to move and by how far by adding top, right, left, or bottom offset properties. To move an element down 10 em-spaces, you would write
        ```
        element {
          position: relative;
          top: 10em;}
        ```
        This will move your specified element down 10 em-spaces in relation to where it would normally be, and not affect any of its surrounding elements.
