      Shereef's Fireside Chat video was interesting, and I ended up watching pretty much the whole thing, so much for timeboxing.

      I thought the restaurant mindset versus the kitchen mindset was an interesting distinction, and really reinforced the team-based nature of learning at Dev Bootcamp. Shereef's hair example made me laugh; instead of complaining and sending your soup back if you find a hair in it, just "slap a hairnet on everyone." It's up to the group to fix the problem, find a solution so it doesn't happen again, and continue to move forward.

      The distinction between "imposter syndrome," fearing that the rest of the cohort is smarter and more advanced, and the "tyranny of the average," feeling bored and better than one's peers, is important, and it is clear that now in Phase 0 and especially in a couple months during the on-site phases, it will be critical not to fall into either of these traps. Personally, I am more at risk for the former, being intimidated by self-acknowledged holes in my knowledge, or feeling inferior for not getting a concept as quickly as somebody else. I am feeling pretty good about DBC's philosophy on these matters though; it's not a race among us all. We'll work together through fun and easy and difficult and frustrating times, and where one person excels at one skill, he or she may completely miss another skill and rely on someone who maybe didn't understand a previous skill but is just killing the current one to teach it to him or her. Critical to this approach is that BOTH parties benefit from these skill disparities, or more specifically, benefit from working through them together as a team. "WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!"

      While I am nervous about the volume of work coming up in future Phase 0 challenges, and especially about the grueling nature of the on-site phases, I am feeling positive about the strong focus on engineering empathy, team work, and viewing these next few months as the "true transformational rite of passage" that Shereef describes. I haven't felt this excited to make a change in my life in as long as I can remember! I am humbled by the pain I know I will feel at times, but I am just thrilled that I am finally learning this stuff, especially at the feet of such conscientious and caring masters. To continue one of Shereef's analogies, I am doing my best to learn the scales now so I can come in and jam with you guys in April. I can't wait!
