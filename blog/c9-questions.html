        I didn't ask too many real questions on the Dev Bootcamp Google+ page other than the various pairing requests I posted. I do remember posting one frantically after I messed up my Bash profile: "Can anyone help me with my terminal? Every command I type in is followed by '-bash: return: 0/Users/natty/.bash_profile: numeric argument required.' I have no idea what this means and I am wasting valuable time trying to figure out. Please help!ï»¿" I quickly received help and resolved the problem, but in hindsight I was a little embarrassed for sounding so panicky when the problem was so easy to fix. I just freaked out!

        In another instance, I got frustrated making a website resemble an overly-complicated wireframe I had produced, and ended up posting to Google+ without a real question. It was more to complain and vent a bit. I didn't realize it at the time! I received many kind responses and again, the problem passed without too much difficulty (it was just a long project). Again, I freaked out and posted without as much regard to my tone as I should have had. Where in the first example at least I had a specific technical problem that we were able to fix, in this case there wasn't really anything anyone could do except comfort me (which they did). But did that warrant a post to the group page? As I toughened up a bit through the next few weeks, I decided it wasn't. But at the time, when I got those responses, they made me feel a lot better! So I guess it really could go either way. I wished I had held off, but the replies I got were immensely helpful at the time.

         The take-away from these and other times I've posted is, if I'm feeling frustrated, and think that sending off a message may elicit a reply that's going to solve my problem, I should probably get up and take a walk first. I posted some pretty passionate posts when I really could have asked things more simply, or at least without as much emotion. I now feel like I should have been more steady in those times of concern and frustration.

        But at the same time, the DBC way seems to emphasize engineering empathy, being open with feelings, and honest with others, so I felt very natural writing these posts as I did so. In fact, part of me was patting myself on the back for being vulnerable as we are asked so often to do! So the real conclusion is, I wasn't really right or wrong in any case. My problems were all resolved quickly after all, and by many, many contributors. The community did step up and answer my questions and try to help me. But I would still write things differently if I could go back and do it again.

        As I look back, I think there is a balance between vulnerability and honesty, and whining, which I want to stay a little more clear of. I felt a genuine reason for reaching out each time I did, and in each case I got the help I needed. But going forward, I want to keep my emotions a little more behind the scenes - take a stretch and think it through if I'm considering posting a message in the heat of frustration. Odds are that no matter what, there will be people there to help, but it's worth a quick cool-off to make sure that the tone matches the magnitude of the problem, and not just the emotions I'm feeling at the moment.
