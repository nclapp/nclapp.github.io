        I don't like conflict. I like everything to be comfortable and happy and conflict-free. This isn't something I've always felt about myself, rather something that has been told to me by the people I love, and that I have slowly learned about myself. I always thought that, if anything, I must be good at resolving conflicts, but in my personal life, perhaps it's not that I face them head on and overcome them, but that I tend to avoid them altogether where I can. In my own everyday life, I try to keep conflict to a minimum. In my old job as an installer and maintainer of aquariums, however, conflict was commonplace, and much of my time was spent managing it.

      <p>
        I have many examples from my time as an aquarist, which was primarily spent traveling to people's fancy homes and offices and working on their aquariums, which in most cases they had completely neglected for a month and which they expected to look like a wild Caribbean reef after two short hours of my trying to offset the previous month of being patently ignored. These aquarium owners, by and large, had no business owning aquariums, and wanted something more in line with a DVD of fish on a reef. Especially with a largely entitled clientele who is used to telling others how they want things, and getting what they want, completely unrealistic expectations combined with a month or more of not paying attention never make for a happy healthy environment. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In these cases, being the professional and the contractor, it wasn't up to me to convince the customers that I was right, that no matter what I did, if they didn't tend to the tank between my visits, it was going to fail. They wouldn't accept any responsibility, since in their minds they were paying me to do that. Rather I would bite my tongue and solve the problem as best I could while keeping them happy, and frustratingly, often acting as if they were right. Month after month, visit after visit. This is customer service - as the saying goes, the customer is always right. (Even though, in my experience, the customer was usually wrong!)

        Repeatedly explaining to a customer that the hundred-dollar corals he kept adding to his tank would keep dying as long as he didn't change his feeding habits, or that as long as she left the algae-cleaning magnet in the tank in the waiting room, kids would drag it through the sand and keep scratching the tank, is frustrating. Conflict easily arises from seeing a very clear problem, being oddly blamed for it, and not being able to say "Hey buddy, this is 100% your fault." It's human nature to fight when wrongly blamed for something - nobody wants to admit doing wrong when they've done everything right. But so much of customer service is doing just that, accepting responsibility and bending to make it right in the customer's mind.

      <p>
        In my personal life, I don't enjoy conflict. I like everyone to get along smiling. I often get frustrated with personal conflicts, and can be quick to get annoyed if I sense someone starting a conflict for what I may see as an unacceptable or frivolous reason. But professionally, I often had to put these feelings aside and solve a conflict that really had no business existing, that was a result of someone else trying to escape blame and effort. And I became infinitely better at biting my tongue and serving the customer during my time as an aquarist. I've tried to take these lessons I learned into my personal life, to use to better understand and solve conflicts, rather than push them away. Sometimes you just have to bite your tongue.

        In life, sometimes it's better to say you're a little wrong and move on, than to be alone knowing you're in the right. After all, nobody can be right all the time!
