      <h3>Pairing:</h3>

      <p>
        I really like pairing, especially at this point in Phase 0 where we are largely on our own. It provides both an outlet to talk to other people who are experiencing the same frustrations and confusion as I am, as well as a great resource for comparing knowledge and methods to solve a problem. Usually I end up pairing for 1.5 hours or so. In every case, my pair partner has spent extra time going over things with me after we completed the challenge, in some cases completing multiple challenges with me. I always start a pair session slightly nervous and apprehensive, and I always end it feeling great. And invariably we finish the challenge much faster and better than I would on my own.

        It has been fun meeting other Dev Bootcamp students face-to-face (if not in person yet). This part of the program especially feels like such a solitary pursuit, and communicating with others in the same boat is both fun and reassuring. A great surprise has been that every single person I've paired with, all ten or twelve or however many, have been cool people I'd be down to get a beer with. People from different places with different backgrounds, but everyone has been nicer than nice and we have much in common.

        It can be frustrating going into a pairing session feeling behind or stressed about the material. I've expected to bomb a couple times and generally am pleasantly surprised to find out that, even if my partner is more advanced, I know more than I often think. For me, it can take teasing this out with another person, which is much of the reason pairing often feels like such a breath of fresh air after struggling through the week's exercises by myself. I don't always realize what I know without thinking and talking it through, and that's not always easy to do alone.

      <h3>Feedback:</h3>

      <p>
        My feedback always makes me feel good! Part of this could be because anything that isn't kind doesn't filter down to me, but I think pretty much all my sessions are up there. I can pretty much remember or tell who wrote each one, and we often have very similar things to say. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading my own feedback is very helpful, principally because it is so encouraging. As I mention above, I have a tendency to self-deprecate (a word some of my feedback even used) and get frustrated if I don't understand a concept quickly. Reading feedback is highly reassuring, letting me know that I'm not as far behind as I think, and that I have even contributed to others' knowledge, while I may be feeling like I'm not contributing much at all. It often points out that I am acting this way, and I'll continue to try to be more confident and assertive going forward. I know that to succeed I have to start owning this stuff and not be so doubtful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing feedback can be a little awkward, but overall it comes pretty naturally. The way to do it is definitely right after finishing a pairing session so everything is fresh in your mind. It can be difficult to come up with actionable feedback sometimes, especially if everything went really well. When I do leave actionable feedback, I often find it applies to both my pair and to myself, and often I'll address it to both of us. And most of that feedback will revolve around being more confident and assertive and sticking to assigned driver/navigator roles, all things with which I struggle too. So when I have a pair like me, while we get along very well and get everything done, we can stray off task and waffle a bit. But hey, it's still fun, and still productive.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can't imagine Phase 0 without pairing, and in some ways wish I paired on every challenge. I definitely would like to continue to pair as often as possible. It is important to spend time studying and working alone too; the reading and the exercises are critical to understand all the complicated material we are covering in these few months. But getting to the next step, real internalization and deep understanding, takes discussion, takes making mistakes and having someone there to help you figure out where and how to fix them, and takes encouragement from peers. Pairing fulfills those goals and more, has already jump-started some new friendships, and is generally one of the more enjoyable and important aspects of Phase 0.
