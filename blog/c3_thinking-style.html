        When I took the Gregorc Personal Thinking Styles test while preparing for Phase 0, I learned I am an <b>Abstract Sequential</b> Thinker. The other three types described in this paradigm are Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random thinkers. <a href="#gregorc")>(See chart below.)</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        An Abstract Sequential thinker is someone who likes to have the facts in front of them and analyze a situation before jumping in, who likes to have experts handy with whom to consult and discuss questions. Someone who struggles when being forced to work in  situations with people on different "wavelengths." And especially when not given what feels like adequate time to finish a project! They can be visual people but still like to proceed in a linear fashion according to a plan. This all sounds like me! In general I've learned to work pretty well within this style of thinking, and I do agree with my designation as an Abstract Sequential thinker. One particular area of Dev Bootcamp that concerns me as it pertains to my style of learning is the frustration I feel when I haven't had enough time to really internalize and learn a task, routine, or method. This seems to be the whole idea behind these Phase 0 weeks; just touching on lots and lots of topics but not really having the time to solidify most of them. As someone who likes to delve deeply into a topic and learn enough to really <em>know</em> that I get it, rather than projecting a little knowledge onto big and maybe misinformed ideas, I often feel doubt that I really fully understand something. I definitely like to have experts around and can find myself deferring to their expertise more easily than I'd like. When I know a little, I feel like I only know enough to know that I don't know everything, rather than feeling like what I do know qualifies me as knowledgeable. It doesn't feel like self-doubt in the sense that I don't think I'm right, just self-awareness in knowing that there is so much more to learn, and that there are others out there with vastly more expertise whose brains I'd like to pick. I need to overcome this by being a little easier on myself, by not expecting to grasp everything instantly and being able to forgive myself for not understanding something easily or as quickly as someone else.

      <p>
        This ties into my mindset as identified in Carol Dweck's idea of a Fixed Mindset versus and Growth Mindset. While I love the idea of a Growth Mindset, in reality I am certainly a Fixed Mindset person. I don't like to fail, so sometimes I won't try things out of a desire not to not succeed easily. I get frustrated with myself when I don't latch onto a concept right away, and that frustration can lead me to be harder on myself than really is fair. My resilience and stamina when working at hard and unfamiliar tasks certainly has room for growth, and that is part of what I was most nervous about before beginning at Dev Bootcamp. I know I'm smart enough, per se, but will I be able to focus and bully my way through the work? I've never been a "good student" despite being bright enough and testing well. Will I become defensive and pessimistic when faced with difficult tasks, since I really want to get this stuff organically and feel like a natural? I need to let myself learn, not get frustrated when I don't know something already. I'm here to learn, not to know things ahead of time! But I like to feel in control of my learning and feel success, and I hate feeling behind and having to scramble to catch up, risking missing something or glancing over a concept I really would like to delve into deeply.

<!--
Gregorc Thinking Style: Abstract Sequential.

What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

Now, contemplate the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.
