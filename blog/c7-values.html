        Accomplishment is a value I hold dear. Many of the times I've felt most  proud of myself have naturally followed personal accomplishments. Finishing something hard is always satisfying. Some challenges are long-term like a college or graduate degree; some are uncomfortable, like a long delivery sail seasick in the cold rain, or a particularly tough workout. Some are purely unwanted, like an unexpected late night at work finishing something up. No matter the challenge, the sense of accomplishment that comes from finishing something hard is why humans keep doing things!

        I'm excited about being a part of Dev Bootcamp because, while I'm proud of myself in general, that feeling of accomplishment hasn't really been around as much lately as I'd like it to be. I was in the same job for over four and a half years and, while I enjoyed it, recently I hadn't been feeling very positive about it because I didn't feel there was any more room for growth, nothing new I could accomplish other than the status quo (and the pay stunk to boot). I was stuck and didn't know how to get unstuck from an esoteric field that didn't make me very hire-able to the non-aquarium world. Dev Bootcamp is a real challenge; it's hard, it's time-consuming, it's relentless. But it's all about stuff I love, stuff I've always wanted to learn. I struggle every day to keep up, often getting frustrated, but constantly remind myself that I knew it would be challenging, that this is actually fun in its own way, and all this hard work will make the payoff that much sweeter. That is accomplishment, and it's a feeling I'm looking forward to feeling in a professional way soon as I enter a new career field I've always wanted to join.

        My girlfriend recently left her office job after seven and a half years. She wants to work in the food world cooking delicious food for lucky people. She once had a huge sense of accomplishment in her old position, but it had waned in recent years; co-workers had become more difficult, office drama become more unavoidable. It wasn't making her happy anymore, as loyal as she felt. And she had this sense of being in the wrong field. It was time to move on. She knew she'd miss her friends, and the sense of others relying on her to do a great job. But the sense of accomplishment was gone.

        She resigned a couple months ago, giving over two months' notice so she could train her replacement and transition smoothly. As the date approached, emotions rose, and she started doubting whether she was doing the right thing. My advice was to point out (as often as I needed to) that having the strength to move on was an accomplishment in itself. In the end, it was the sense of accomplishment that came from knowing it was time, and following through, that made finally leaving so much more rewarding. She hadn't been able to accomplish what she wanted to at her old job anymore so she left. She needed to be, and is, proud of herself for taking a huge leap, for leaving one job without having another lined up. Accomplishment doesn't have to be finishing a grand project, or winning anything. Taking a huge risk and leaving a comfortable job because you know it's time is an accomplishment in itself.

        As we get closer and closer to the on-site portion of Dev Bootcamp, my anxiety is rising, and I need to keep things in perspective. I am in the middle of something very hard. I will feel down and frustrated at times. Hey I felt down earlier today stuck on a JavaScript challenge. But taking a break and shaking it out, and reminding myself why I'm doing this, what I'm here for, helps me to refocus. Having those feelings doesn't mean I all of a sudden figure out the challenge, but it often does help. Little accomplishments like the elation of being stuck on a problem and finally figuring it out add up and make it possible to keep going, not to give up. Small personal victories add up to one huge accomplishment.
