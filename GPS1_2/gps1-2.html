    <p>Paired programming is the process of two people working together on one problem, with one acting as "driver" and one as "navigator." The driver typically will be the one doing the typing while the navigator observes and helps the driver know what to write by pointing out steps in the plan they have come up with together.</p>
      
    <p>Paired programming has many advantages! The first and most obvious one is simply that each programmer is not alone, and so has the benefit of a whole extra brain to help work through problems. This could come in handy in the initial stages of planning and wireframing as the pair bounces ideas off of each other, and also in later coding stages where each pair member may have different ideas about how to proceed.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, if one pair member gets stuck, then the other part of the pair can help rescue his or her partner by getting them out of their head and refocusing them on the task at hand. This can either be a simple attitude adjustment, or a piece of technical advice to get someone unstuck, or simply the presence of the person making the stuck pair member accountable to someone other than themself. ("If you don't get unstuck, you're holding us both back!")</p>
    
    <p>And finally, paired programming provides a good external motivator to stay on track. It's easy to be distracted by such real-world activities as emails, chores, family and other inputs in our lives; having another person there keeps us focused on the task at hand.</p>
    
    
    <p>The navigator of a paired session is typically the one guiding the actions and plan, while the driver is the one literally doing in the typing. But this can be a bit deceiving; in reality both people are coming up with a mutual plan for the project, just with each taking on very specific duties when it comes to the actual movement of the plan versus the typing-in of the plan.</p>

MY REFLECTION:

This went pretty well. I was a little worried about having to use the CSS Position and Display properties that troubled me so much last week but it didn't really come up. I worked with Jason Pettus and it was nice to put a face to a name after trading messages on G+.

It felt pretty comfortable, we got along fine and our guide Jess was nice. As she pointed out in our feedback (delivered in record time!), we didn't do the greatest job of sticking to our defined driver and navigator roles; it was a little more wishy-washy and we both kind of did both. Even after Jessica told us to swap roles (part of the challenge), we did at first but then fell back into a more conversational, collaborative tone. This worked well for us but I can see how it may not for others.

Another thing Jessica pointed out was that we didn't really check in at the beginning of the session. Again, it was fine in this case, but she raised the point that when we get on-site it will be more important in case somebody is having a bad day. Important to know this to avoid getting dragged down unfairly or unexectedly, and to help you help them work through it.

I think we both did pretty well on the learning competencies. Everything we needed to do was pretty basic and not too crazy or obscure.
